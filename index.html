# Python in Science 
### Or how can Python help us understand the human brain? 

PyLadies Berlin, November 2013

## What does Python have to do with brains?

---

## The human brain

* Is only 2% of the weight of the body, but consumes approx. 25% of energy

* Contains 100,000,000,000 neurons which are connected with 100, 000,000,000,000 synapses. There are more synapses in the brain than stars in the Milky way!

* Grey brain matter (*neocortex*) is doing "the" job and white brain matter is for communication between neurons

* Unrolling the neocortex would give us around four A4 sheets

---

## Can you actually explain how the whole brain works?

* Maybe, but it is very hard. We split the problem of understanding the brain into smaller ones and divide them to different researchers:

    * How does learning work?
    * How is information encoded in the brain?
    * How does human vision work?
    * How do we know that we are happy and not sad?

---

## Neuroscience

* Studies central nervous system (brain + spinal cord)

* Many different subdisciplines that investigate different aspects of human brain
    
    * To name a few: neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, clinical neuroscience, neurolinguistics, neuroeconomics and computational neuroscience

* Computational neuroscience is a young discipline that uses math, computer science, physics, philosophy and psychology to explain mechanisms in the human brain

## Why do scientists need to code?                

* Store and process data

* Make simulations

* Extract patterns and make predictions using data 

* Make pretty plots of their data and results 

---


## Why do scientists love Python?                  
Because

## Where Python meets Science

<img src="img/scipy.png">

* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering

* Actively maintained and supported by a huge community (mailing lists, Q&A pages, SciPy conferences)

* Some of the included packages: NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython, Pandas...

* There are two options to get these packages
    * Download each package separately
    * Get the whole set as a single installation file: [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) or [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)


---

## Step 0: IPython

* [IPython](http://ipython.org/) is a simple yet powerful interactive environment to write Python code

* It's similar to the standard Python interpreter, but provides more functionality which makes coding easier and more efficient

* For example: auto-completion using `tab`, save values and restore them later, the history of commands, timing of functions

---

## Dealing with numbers: NumPy

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is a powerful Python package for efficient manipulation with numbers 

* Numbers are "the data": measurements from experiments, results of computer simulations, etc.

* Numbers are stored in containers called `arrays` 

* For MATLAB users planning to switch to Python there is a [cheat sheet](http://wiki.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users)
 

---

### NumPy Array

* Basic data structure used to store numbers

* Arrays can be vectors (one-dimensional) or matrices (two-dimensional)

    * Vector containing four numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
    * Matrix containing six numbers in two rows and three columns: 
        
        `[[1, 2, 3],`
        
        ` [4, 5, 6]]`


* Indexing starts with `0` (not `1`), so the first element in a vector is at the `0`-th position


---

``` python
>>> import numpy as np

# Create an array with numbers from 0 to 15
>>> a = np.arange(0, 15)
>>> a
array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14])

# What is the first element in the array? 
>>> a[0]
0

# What is the shape of our array?
>>> a.shape
(15,)

# Make a new array, this time with rows and columns
>>> b = a.reshape(3,5)
>>> b
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])
>>> b.shape
(3, 5)

# Get all the numbers in the second row 
>>> b[1, :]
array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

>>> type(b)
<type 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

<img src="img/matplotlib.png" />
    
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a Python package for data plotting

* Supports different plotting options: histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots... with just a few lines of code

* Ok, let's plot in Python!

### Study: How does the amount of chocolate influence happiness?

<img src="img/simple_plot.png" width="50%"/> 

---

### Plotting code

```python
>>> import matplotlib.pylab as pl
>>> import numpy as np

# Load data on a drive into two NumPy arrays
>>> chocolate = np.load('chocolate.npy')
>>> happy = np.load('happiness.npy')

# Plot array chocolate vs array happy
>>> pl.plot(choc, happy)

# Label horizontal axis (x) and vertical axis (y)
>>> pl.xlabel('Chocolate (gram)')
>>> pl.ylabel('Happiness (smiling)')

# Give a title to our plot
>>> pl.title('Influence of chocolate on happiness')

>>> pl.grid(True)
>>> pl.savefig("chocolate.png")
>>> pl.show()
```

### With matplotlib you can do this

<img src="img/heart.png" />
<img src="img/histogram.png" />

---

### ... and this! 

<img src="img/hist2d_demo.png" />
<img src="img/polys3d_demo.png" />

* And much more! These examples are taken from the gallery at the [matplotlib page](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html#) which contains many beautiful plots and the source code used to generate them

---

## NLTK

* [Natural language toolkit](http://nltk.org/) suitable for linguists, engineers, students, educators, researchers, and industry users alike 

* Suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging and parsing

* Example applications: RSS Feeds, extracting text from PDF, Word documents, Tweets ...                   

---

## More on NLTK

* Fundamentals of writing Python programs, working with corpora, categorizing text, analyzing linguistic structure...

* Available [online](http://nltk.org/book/) for free:

## A peek into the NLTK

```python
>>> import nltk
>>> sentence = "Good evening! Would you like some tea?"
>>> tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
>>> tokens
['Good', 'evening', '!', 'Would', 'you', 'like', 'some', 'tea', '?']
>>> tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
>>> tagged
[('Good', 'NNP'), ('evening', 'NN'), ('!', '.'), 
('Would', 'MD'), ('you', 'PRP'), ('like', 'VB'), 
('some', 'DT'), ('tea', 'NN'), ('?', '.')]

# NNP and NN is abbreviation for a noun, VB for a verb and PRP for a personal pronoun
```

### Reading Jane Austen's Emma with NLTK *


* NLTK also includes short excerpts from some books provided by the Project Gutenberg

```python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids()
['austen-emma.txt', 'austen-persuasion.txt', 'austen-sense.txt', 
'bible-kjv.txt', 'blake-poems.txt', 'bryant-stories.txt', 
'burgess-busterbrown.txt', ..., 
'shakespeare-hamlet.txt', 'shakespeare-macbeth.txt', 'whitman-leaves.txt']

>>> emma = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt')
>>> emma[10:20]
['I', 'Emma', 'Woodhouse', ',', 'handsome', ',', 'clever', ',', 'and', 'rich']

>>> print "Number of words:", len(emma)
Number of words: 192427
```
<small>\* But I'd rather recommend a cup of tea and a blanket istead of Python for book reading </small>

## <img src="img/scikit.png" width="40%">

* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html): satisifes all the data mining and data analysis needs 

* Abundance of algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning 

* Classification, regression, clustering, model selection, dimensionality reduction and data preprocessing

---

## <img src="img/mdp_logo_animation.gif" width="40%">

* [MDP](http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/) is a modular toolkit for data processing

* Set of algorithms for data mining, classification, signal processing, pattern recognition...

* In MDP every algorithm is referred to as a `node` which can be modified by a user

* Built on NumPy and SciPy

---

## MDP: Detection of objects

* Imagine having 2D geometrical objects such as filled or emtpy circles and rectangles which are made of random points, for example:
<center> <img src="img/mdp_randomdata.png"> </center>

* Our goal is to find out how many objects there are in this image


---

## MDP: Detection of objects

* There are many ways to solve this problem, but we love neurons and will use a special type of a neural network called [growing neural gas (GNG)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_gas) to solve it

* GNG spreads a sheet of neurons over the data and tries to position neurons so they maximally cover clusters of data

* At every time step, the number of neurons in network increase until some final condition is met

### Neural network in the beginning...


<center> <img src="img/mdp_initial.png" width="80%"> </center>

---

### ... and after the learning!


<center><img src="img/mdp_trained.png" width="80%" /> </center>


---

### Code that does what we have just seen:

```python
import mdp

x = generate_random_circles_and_rectangles()

gng = mdp.nodes.GrowingNeuralGasNode(max_nodes=75)

STEP = 500
for i in range(0, x.shape[0], STEP):
    gng.train(x[i:i+STEP])
gng.stop_training()

n_obj = len(gng.graph.connected_components())
print n_obj
```

```
Output: 5
